## 🌟 Key Features

- 🎨 **Redesigned Brand Logo (`<O✦>`)**: Custom cyan-teal vector logo combining code brackets `< >`, central ring `O`, and glowing spark `✦`, integrated seamlessly across panel icons, header containers, SVGs, and system theme icon sizes (16px–128px).
- 🐧 **Full GNOME Shell Extension**:
  - Pure monochrome symbolic icon (`opencodego-symbolic.svg`) matching GNOME Shell top-bar indicators.
  - Full-color glowing brand header in popup card (`opencodego-brand.svg`).
  - Sleek popup with progress bars, reset countdowns, and currency quota metrics ($ spent / $ limit).
  - Instant in-popup **Refresh** button that updates figures live without dismissing the menu.
  - Libadwaita Preferences dialog with interactive **Test Connection** and step-by-step **Session Cookie Guide**.
  - Flexible top-bar display modes: Weekly Limit (Default), 5-Hour Rolling Limit, Monthly Limit, All Three Limits with icons, or Icon Only.
  - Quota alert notifications and Compact Mode toggle.
- 📊 **Real-Time Usage Tracking**: Fetches live data from the OpenCode Console JSON API `opencode.ai/console/api/go/status` via `curl`. Supports route-walk resilience, transient 5xx retry handling, and graceful stale-figures fallback.
- ⏱️ **Per-Window Reset Countdowns**: Natural-language `(resets in 3 hours 45 minutes)` countdowns for Rolling (5h), Weekly, and Monthly windows.
- 📐 **Horizontal Progress Bars**: Smooth rounded progress bars with responsive color accents (sky, cyan, teal) and automatic warning shifts (≥75% orange, ≥90% red).
- 🏷️ **Dynamic Panel Tray Badge**: Real-time headline usage percentage badge directly in your desktop top bar or taskbar.
- 🎨 **12 Developer Theme Presets (KDE)**: Catppuccin Mocha (default), Breeze Dark, Nord, Dracula, Solarized, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night, One Dark, plus 4 light themes with full color pickers.
- 💻 **Global CLI Utility (`opencode-usage`)**: Terminal client with formatted tables, JSON mode (`--json`), CSV export (`--export`), and interactive setup wizard (`--interactive` / `-i`).
- 📦 **Open Source**: Full source, issue tracker, and releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mayanktaker/OpencodeGo-KDE-GNOME) — linked with icons right from the widget's About page.

## 🚀 Installation

### KDE Plasma 6 Plasmoid

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mayanktaker/OpencodeGo-KDE-GNOME.git
cd OpencodeGo-KDE-GNOME
./install.sh
```

This automatically:
1. Installs/upgrades the plasmoid to `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/`
2. Registers custom icons in `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/`
3. Purges QML caches and restarts `plasmashell`
4. Links `opencode-usage` CLI to `~/.local/bin/`
5. Installs Bash tab completions

---

## 🐧 GNOME Shell Extension

The same usage tracker also ships as a GNOME Shell panel extension (UUID `com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage`, GNOME Shell 46–50):

```bash
bash gnome-extension/install.sh
```

- Hover the panel icon to see Rolling (5h)/Weekly/Monthly usage; without credentials it shows demo data.
- The panel shows the weekly percentage next to the icon — orange at 75%, red at 90%. Switch it off in settings if you prefer icon only.
- The popup ends with **Open OpenCode Console** and **Settings…** — both stay available even when your sign-in has expired.
- The panel now shows the O✦ logo on GNOME too, not just on KDE.
- Open the extension's preferences (`gnome-extensions prefs com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage`) and paste your Workspace ID + Auth Cookie to switch to live figures. **Test** checks your details without waiting for a refresh.
- On Wayland, the first install needs a logout/login: a running shell never picks up a newly installed extension. The installer queues it so it comes up enabled automatically.

### Installing on Manjaro / Arch

```bash
# 1. install (from a clone, or from the gnome-extension/ folder of a release bundle)
bash gnome-extension/install.sh

# 2. log out and back in  — required on Wayland, there is no rescan

# 3. confirm it is running
gnome-extensions info com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage | grep -E 'State|Enabled'
journalctl --user -b | grep -i opencodego        # should be quiet

# 4. add your details
gnome-extensions prefs com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage
```

Step 1 copies the extension into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage`, compiles its gsettings schema, and queues it in dconf so it comes up enabled after the logout.

Getting the two values for step 4: open `https://opencode.ai/console/<your-workspace>/go` in the browser, then DevTools → Application → Cookies → opencode.ai → `__Host-console_session` for the cookie, and the `wrk_…` in the address bar for the workspace id. Paste them in and press **Test**.

Updating later: re-run `bash gnome-extension/install.sh` and log out/in again — a running shell keeps the old code.

To remove it:

```bash
gnome-extensions disable com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage   # if the shell knows it
rm -rf ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage
dconf write /org/gnome/shell/enabled-extensions "['gnome-shell-extensions-appindicator@ubuntu.com']"  # keep your other extensions
```

## 📦 Download & Releases

Prefer a ready-made bundle? Grab the latest `.plasmoid` package, GNOME extension zip, or the shareable `.zip` (includes the installer + CLI) from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Mayanktaker/OpencodeGo-KDE-GNOME/releases). Install a downloaded `.plasmoid` with:

```bash
kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet -i com.mayanktaker.opencodego-usage-v*.plasmoid
```

---

## 🔑 How to Get Your Workspace ID & Auth Cookie

1. Open the OpenCode Console Go page: `https://opencode.ai/console/wrk_XXXXXXXX/go` (sign in if prompted). Use the console — `/usage` is a separate cost dashboard, not the Go usage page.
2. Copy the workspace ID from the browser URL bar (it starts with `wrk_`, e.g. `wrk_01KE20AQRQ9QR7N15TWGJBE2V9`; `org_...` ids work too). It is sent in the `x-org-id` header on every request.
3. Press `F12` → **Application** → **Cookies** → `opencode.ai`.
4. Copy the **`__Host-console_session`** cookie value (a short opaque token, ~39 characters, e.g. `st_...`) — **not** `auth`. The old iron-session `auth=Fe26.2**` cookie no longer authenticates the console.
5. Right-click the widget → **Configure** → paste **Workspace ID** and the cookie value.
6. Click **Apply** or **OK**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

- **Network Transport**: Qt's QML XHR silently strips the `Cookie` header (Qt `CookieLoadControlAttribute`), so `UsageFetcher.qml` shells out to `curl` via Plasma's `executable` dataengine. The cookie is shell-quoted before inlining.
- **Data Parsing**: `api.js` parses the console `go/status` JSON response (`access.meters.fiveHour` / `week` / `month`, BigInt money fields as strings), converting each meter into a percentage, reset countdown, and progress bar.
- **QML Bindings**: Child components must qualify parent properties with the parent's `id` (e.g., `fullRoot.usagePercent`) — unqualified names resolve to the child's own property, creating silent self-binding loops.

---

## ✨ What's New in v2.5.0

- **Now on GNOME Shell as well as KDE Plasma** — a panel icon that shows your Rolling (5h), Weekly, and Monthly usage on hover, with its own settings window.
- The GNOME panel icon now uses the same O✦ logo as the KDE widget, and shows your weekly percentage next to it (orange at 75%, red at 90%) — switch the badge off in settings if you prefer icon only.
- The GNOME popup has **Open OpenCode Console** and **Settings…** entries, and they still work when your sign-in has expired.
- GNOME settings include a **Test** button that checks your details straight away.
- The GNOME panel icon shows up reliably after a fresh install instead of silently not appearing.
- The GNOME settings window opens its contents properly.
- During a brief OpenCode outage, GNOME keeps your last known figures instead of replacing them with an error.
- The GNOME popup no longer duplicates itself after a refresh.
- GNOME no longer waits on the network in the background, so the desktop stays responsive while usage is checked.
- The download bundle now includes the GNOME extension, and builds always pick up the current version number.
- Full release notes live in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## ⚠️ Known Issue: Brief "Temporarily Unavailable" Messages

OpenCode's usage page itself sometimes answers with a short outage (even in a browser). The widget retries automatically and keeps your last numbers on screen, then picks up fresh numbers on the next refresh — no action needed. If you see it often, you can report it to OpenCode with this template:

> Subject: `GET /console/api/go/status` returns intermittent HTTP 500
> Body: "While signed in, `GET https://opencode.ai/console/api/go/status` (with `x-org-id`) intermittently returns `500 {\"_tag\":\"InternalServerError\"}` — roughly 6 of 8 tries during one window — while `/console/api/orgs` stays 200. Seen on 2026-09-18. Please investigate."
